Simple sudoku solver. See Peter Norvig's (sudoku page)[http://norvig.com/sudoku.html] for an in depth guide on sudoku solving.

Note that this solution is not an optimal one, it is only a proof of concept I wanted to try. Norvig used strings as representing cells whereas I'm using sets and lists for the whole puzzle (ie. rows etc.) What data structure you use greatly effects how you solve a problem in general and I was curious about using lists and sets. Norvig uses plain strings so you should really go ahead and see how he does it.
